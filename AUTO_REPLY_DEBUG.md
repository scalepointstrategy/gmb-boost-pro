# Auto Review Reply - Debug Guide

## ‚úÖ Fixes Applied

### **Issue**: Auto review replier not working in real-time
### **Root Causes Found**:
1. **60-second interval too slow** - Changed to 15 seconds for better real-time response
2. **Service started before Google Business Profile connection** - Added connection checking
3. **Insufficient logging** - Added comprehensive debugging logs

### **Fixes Implemented**:

#### 1. **Faster Check Interval**
- **Before**: 60 seconds between checks
- **After**: 15 seconds between checks
- **Result**: Much more responsive to new reviews

#### 2. **Smart Connection Management**
- Added connection checking before starting automation
- Service waits for Google Business Profile to be fully connected
- Auto-restarts if connection is lost

#### 3. **Enhanced Debugging**
- Comprehensive logging for all automation steps
- Real-time status monitoring
- Global debugging access in development mode

## üõ†Ô∏è Debug Tools Available

### **In Browser Console** (Development Mode):
```javascript
// Check if automation is running
reviewAutomationService.isServiceRunning()

// Force an immediate check (useful for testing)
await reviewAutomationService.forceCheck()

// Restart the automation service
reviewAutomationService.restart()

// Check current configurations
reviewAutomationService.getConfiguration('your-location-id')
```

### **Monitor Automation Logs**:
Open browser console and look for these log messages:
- `ü§ñ AUTOMATION: Review automation service initialized`
- `‚úÖ AUTOMATION: Google Business Profile is connected, starting automation`
- `üîÑ AUTOMATION: Starting review check cycle...`
- `üìã AUTOMATION: Config - BusinessName (locationId) - Auto-reply: ON`
- `üîç AUTOMATION: Found X enabled review configurations`

## üö® Troubleshooting

### **If Auto-Reply Still Not Working**:

#### 1. **Check if Automation is Running**:
```javascript
// In browser console:
reviewAutomationService.isServiceRunning()
// Should return: true
```

#### 2. **Check Google Business Profile Connection**:
- Make sure you're logged in to Google Business Profile
- Look for: `‚úÖ AUTOMATION: Google Business Profile is connected`

#### 3. **Check Auto-Reply Configuration**:
- Go to Dashboard ‚Üí Select a Profile ‚Üí Reviews Tab
- Ensure "Enable Auto-Reply" toggle is **ON**
- Set appropriate rating filters (e.g., min: 1, max: 5)

#### 4. **Force a Manual Check**:
```javascript
// In browser console:
await reviewAutomationService.forceCheck()
```

#### 5. **Check for New Reviews**:
- Automation only replies to reviews without existing replies
- Make sure there are actually new reviews to reply to

### **Expected Behavior**:
1. Service starts 5 seconds after app loads
2. Checks for Google Business Profile connection every 15 seconds until connected
3. Once connected, checks for new reviews every 15 seconds
4. Automatically replies to new reviews that meet criteria
5. Shows notifications for successful auto-replies

### **Debug Logs to Look For**:

**Good Signs**:
- `‚úÖ AUTOMATION: Google Business Profile is connected, starting automation`
- `üéØ AUTOMATION: Processing location: YourBusinessName`
- `ü§ñ AUTOMATION: Generating auto-reply for review...`
- `‚úÖ AUTOMATION: Successfully posted auto-reply for review...`

**Problem Signs**:
- `‚è≥ AUTOMATION: Waiting for Google Business Profile connection...`
- `‚ÑπÔ∏è AUTOMATION: No enabled auto-reply configurations found`
- `‚ùå AUTOMATION: Failed to process review...`

## üéØ Quick Test

1. **Enable auto-reply** for at least one location in Reviews tab
2. **Open browser console** and run: `reviewAutomationService.forceCheck()`
3. **Check logs** for automation activity
4. **Look for notifications** in the app

## ‚ö° Performance Improvements

- **Reduced check interval**: 60s ‚Üí 15s (4x faster response)
- **Smart connection handling**: No wasted API calls when not connected
- **Parallel review processing**: Multiple locations processed efficiently
- **Cached API responses**: Faster subsequent checks

Your auto-reply system should now work in real-time! üöÄ
