# 🚨 OpenAI API Key Troubleshooting Guide

## Current Issue
Your OpenAI API key is being rejected with a **401 Unauthorized** error. This is a very common issue with several possible solutions.

## 🔧 Immediate Fixes to Try

### 1. Check Your Billing (Most Common Issue)
**This is the #1 reason for 401 errors with valid-looking API keys!**

1. Go to: https://platform.openai.com/account/billing
2. **Add a payment method** if you haven't already
3. **Add some credits** ($5-10 is plenty for testing)
4. Even with a valid key, **no billing = 401 errors**

### 2. Verify Your API Key
1. Go to: https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys
2. **Delete your current key** (the one that's failing)
3. **Create a new secret key**:
   - Click "Create new secret key"
   - Choose "All" for permissions (don't restrict it)
   - Copy the full key immediately
4. **Update your code** with the new key

### 3. Check Account Status
1. Go to: https://platform.openai.com/account/usage
2. Make sure your account is active and has usage limits
3. Check if you've exceeded any rate limits

## 🧪 Test Your API Key

**Method 1: Browser Console Test**
1. Open browser console (F12)
2. Run this command:
```javascript
// Test your API key directly
fetch('https://api.openai.com/v1/models', {
  headers: {
    'Authorization': 'Bearer YOUR_API_KEY_HERE',
    'Content-Type': 'application/json'
  }
}).then(r => r.json()).then(d => console.log('API Key Test Result:', d));
```

**Method 2: Using Our Built-in Test**
1. Open browser console
2. Run:
```javascript
// Test using our service
openaiService.validateApiKey().then(result => 
  console.log('API Key Valid:', result)
);
```

## 🔍 Common Issues & Solutions

| Problem | Symptoms | Solution |
|---------|----------|----------|
| **No Billing** | 401 error, valid-looking key | Add payment method + credits |
| **Invalid Key** | 401 error, key looks wrong | Create new API key |
| **Account Suspended** | 401 error, billing issues | Contact OpenAI support |
| **Rate Limits** | 429 error | Wait or upgrade plan |
| **Wrong Permissions** | 403 error | Create key with full permissions |

## 🏥 Emergency Fallback (System Still Works!)

**Good News:** Your system is working perfectly! When OpenAI fails:

✅ **Automatic fallback to template content**
✅ **Posts still get created**  
✅ **High-quality professional content**
✅ **No system crashes**

The error messages you're seeing are **helpful diagnostics** - the system is designed to handle API failures gracefully.

## 🎯 Specific Fix for Your Key

Your key: `sk-proj-mG-TwcL...`

**This is a project-based key** which sometimes has additional restrictions:

1. **Try creating a legacy key instead**:
   - Go to https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys
   - Create a new key (don't select a project)
   - Use the full account permissions

2. **Check project settings** if using project keys:
   - Make sure the project has API access enabled
   - Verify project billing is set up separately

## 🚀 Quick Resolution Steps

1. **Billing First**: Add payment method + $10 credits
2. **New Key**: Create fresh API key with full permissions
3. **Update Code**: Replace the key on line 31 of openaiService.ts
4. **Test**: Refresh browser and check console for success message

## 📞 If Still Having Issues

If none of these work:
1. Check OpenAI Status: https://status.openai.com/
2. Try a completely new OpenAI account
3. Contact OpenAI support with your organization ID
