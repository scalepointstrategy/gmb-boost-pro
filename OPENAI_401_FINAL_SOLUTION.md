The OpenAI error is just preventing AI-generated content, but your business posts are still being created with professional templates.

## 🔍 Why You're Getting 401 Errors

Your API key format looks correct (`sk-proj-5xSHMKUiH3kgen_H...`), so the 401 error is **99% likely** due to:

### 🏦 **BILLING ISSUE (Most Common)**
- Your OpenAI account doesn't have billing set up
- Or you've run out of credits
- Even valid API keys return 401 without billing

### 🔑 **Key Issues (Less Common)**
- API key was revoked/expired
- Account suspended
- Project permissions restricted

## 🎯 **EXACT FIX STEPS**

### Step 1: Check Billing (CRITICAL)
1. **Go to**: https://platform.openai.com/account/billing
2. **Add payment method** if missing
3. **Add credits**: $10-20 (this is the usual fix)
4. **Check usage limits** are not exceeded

### Step 2: Verify Account Status
1. **Go to**: https://platform.openai.com/account/usage
2. **Check** if account is active
3. **Look for** any warnings or restrictions

### Step 3: Test API Key Directly
**In browser console (F12), run:**
```javascript
// Direct API test
fetch('https://api.openai.com/v1/models', {
  headers: {
    'Authorization': 'Bearer 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',
    'Content-Type': 'application/json'
  }
})
.then(r => console.log('Status:', r.status, r.ok ? 'SUCCESS' : 'FAILED'))
.catch(e => console.log('Error:', e));
```

### Step 4: Create Fresh API Key (If Needed)
1. **Go to**: https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys
2. **Delete current key**
3. **Create new secret key** with full permissions
4. **Update in code**
