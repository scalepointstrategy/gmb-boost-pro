- No more exposed API keys in source code
- This was a major security vulnerability that has been resolved

âœ… **Updated .env file configuration**
- Removed invalid/exposed API key from `.env`
- Added clear instructions and examples for setting up OpenAI API key
- Added URL reference to OpenAI's API keys page

### ðŸš€ Application Configuration
âœ… **Fixed server port conflicts**
- Changed backend server from port 8088 to 5001
- Updated frontend to connect to localhost:5001 instead of Azure endpoint
- Both servers now running without port conflicts

âœ… **Improved error handling and user feedback**
- Enhanced console messages when OpenAI API key is missing
- Added clear instructions for users on how to get an API key
- Better fallback messaging when using template content

### ðŸ“š Documentation
âœ… **Created comprehensive OpenAI API Setup Guide** (`OPENAI_API_SETUP.md`)
- Step-by-step instructions for obtaining an OpenAI API key
- Billing setup requirements and cost estimates
- Troubleshooting common issues
- Security best practices

## Current Status

### âœ… What's Working Now
- **Frontend**: Running on http://localhost:3001
- **Backend**: Running on http://localhost:5001  
- **Security**: All hardcoded API keys removed
- **Fallback Content**: High-quality template posts will be used when no OpenAI key is configured
- **Error Handling**: Clear messages guide users on API key setup

### ðŸ”§ To Enable AI-Generated Content
1. Get an OpenAI API key from https://platform.openai.com/api-keys
2. Add it to the `.env` file: `VITE_OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-proj-your-key-here`
3. Restart the development server
4. Posts will now use AI-generated content instead of templates

### ðŸ§ª How to Test

#### Test OpenAI Service (Browser Console)
```javascript
// Open browser console (F12) and run:
window.testOpenAI()
```

#### Test Backend Health
```bash
curl http://localhost:5001/health
```

#### Test Post Creation
- Navigate to the Posts section in the app
- Try creating a post
- Without OpenAI key: Uses high-quality template content
- With OpenAI key: Uses AI-generated personalized content

## Code Changes Made

### Files Modified
1. `src/lib/openaiService.ts` - Removed hardcoded API key, improved error messages
2. `.env` - Updated with proper configuration and documentation
3. `server/.env` - Fixed port configuration and frontend URL
4. Created `OPENAI_API_SETUP.md` - Comprehensive setup guide
5. Created this `FIXES_COMPLETED.md` - Summary of all changes

### Key Security Improvements
